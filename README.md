# GregsWork
Check out my GitHub portfolio and witness the awesomeness of my coding skills. 
I bring personality and drive to every project, whether it's automating a tedious task, building a cool new tool, or analyzing data to uncover hidden insights. 
Let's team up and tackle the world of coding together


Hi, I'm Greg!
I'm a young software and robotics engineer with a passion for learning, experimenting and creating innovative solutions to complex problems. 
With 4 years of experience in coding, I have developed a strong foundation in Python, C++, MATLAB and SolidWorks and am always looking to expand my skillset.


Why Hire Me?
I'm not your average software engineer. 
Sure, I can write clean, efficient code, but what sets me apart is my willingness to take on new challenges and my ability to think outside the box. 
Whether it's diving into a new coding language or taking on a complex robotics project, I'm always eager to learn and try new things.

I'm not afraid to take on responsibility and deliver results. 
But I also know how to have fun along the way. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with electronics, playing with my robots, or reading up on philosophy (stoic).

Let's Work Together
If you're looking for a software or robotics engineer who is ready to learn, willing to try new things, and not afraid of responsibility, then look no further. 
I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and companies who share my passion for innovation and creativity. 
Let's build something amazing together!
